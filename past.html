                <h2>Research</h2>
                <h3 id="prob">Problem Space</h3>
                <p>Sundaland’s main mission is to provide another option for consumers which avoids encouraging hyper consumerism and waste while promoting sustainability. Many large corporations today, such as Amazon, run their business on the principle of quantity over quality. While this business model appeals to many people due to its convenience and profitability, it is highly unethical. As many people start to favor online shopping over brick and mortar shops, the influence of these major corporations are taking a toll on small businesses.</p>
                <p>I found that there was a lack of ethical alternatives for websites like Amazon, and wanted to fill that void with a business that is just as convenient for consumers. Sundaland’s goal is to reduce today’s society’s reliance on huge corporations by <mark>providing a space for smaller businesses to unite and reach more consumers, while also delivering higher quality products, all in a sustainable way.</mark></p>
                <h3 id="keystake">Key Stakeholders</h3>
                <p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><em>Environmentally Conscious Consumers:</em> They are motivated to reduce their carbon footprint, and have already implemented new habits or are willing to learn. They also most likely have a higher income, due to the fact that sustainable products are usually more expensive than other products.</li>
                        <li><em>Sustainable Small Businesses:</em> Sundaland’s business model would also appeal to small businesses who struggle with losing their clients to larger companies. Sundaland prioritizes getting small, local businesses the exposure they need to reach their full potential.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <h3 id="person">Personas</h3>
                <div class="img1">
                    <img class="pic" src="./photos/past/mackenziepersona.png" alt="Persona description for Mackenzie, the 'Broke College Student'">
                    <img class="pic" src="./photos/past/mirandapersona.png" alt="Persona description for Miranda, the 'Conscious Mother'">
                </div>
                <p>When making personas for this project, I decided to focus first on the customers stakeholder as this would be easier to be put through user testing due to a larger applicable target market to test.</p>
                <p>The first character attribute I decided to focus on with the personas was how sustainably focused they are. I took into account how aware they are of sustainable products, as well as if they currently buy sustainable products or are interested in buying sustainable products. The second character attribute I decided on was to measure how tech savvy they are. This is to measure if they would be familiar with online marketplaces and would be able to use Sundaland easily and efficiently. I was also looking to see if the personas would be willing to learn certain behaviors that would allow them to use the platform. Lastly, the third attribute I decided to use was the amount of budget allocated for online shopping. I wanted to measure how much money the personas had to spend on online marketplaces. If they have a larger budget they would be more likely to spend more money for sustainable products as well.</p>
                <p><mark>A limitation of Mackenzie is that she might be hard to attract when Sundaland first launches because of the increased price point.</mark> She is set in her routine because she has no time to try something new, but this could be an opportunity for Sundaland to add in some sort of feature that creates an easy transition from other marketplaces.</p>
                <p>A large strength of Miranda is that she is part of Sundaland's main target market. <mark>When creating the product, I first wanted to make sure that the product was friendly to her, before focusing on accomodating other personas like Mackenzie.</mark></p>
                <h3 id="reqgat">Requirements Gathering</h3>
                <h4 id="metho">Methodology</h4>
                <p>To gather data, I used a Google Form asking participants about their online shopping habits and preferences. I found that this method best fit the infomation I wanted to collect, since it allowed me to reach a wide variety of participants, enforce certain answer restrictions, and efficiently record the data.</p>
                <p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJwDC9hUBM6gkV_fR5rREE3EDi5vGpWDcxZkfN28E-6wB4kg/viewform">View Form Here</a></p>
                <img class="pic1" src="./photos/past/Survey2.png" alt="Google Forms survey, second image, which can also be found through the link above">
                <img class="pic1" src="./photos/past/Survey1.png" alt="Google Forms survey, first image, which can also be found through the link above">
                <p>In order to gain a better understanding of my target market and their needs, I asked questions mainly about Amazon and other major ecommerce websites, focusing on what they liked or disliked, what items were purchased most frequently, and their opinion on sustainability. I first asked questions about participants' shopping habits, and then transitioned to questions more focused on sustainability, as to not lead the participant’s answers to be biased due to the priming effect.</p>
                <p><mark>My main goal was to collect data that would allow me to see competitor’s weaknesses and strengths to strategically construct the business model to fill those gaps</mark>, while also maintaining and improving upon the elements that participants liked. I also collected data concerning participant demographics, including age, gender, and occupation. This would give insight into who my customer base is and isn’t, which will be crucial in the development of the business model. While most of the responses were from college age students, I was able to generate responses from older demographics as well. The survey generated 45 responses in total.</p>
                <h4 id="res">Results</h4>
                <p>The survey revealed several important pieces of information that helped guide certain features I decided to include and not include in the initial designs for Sundaland. All of the answers to the survey can be found below:</p>
                <img class="pic2" src="./photos/past/Results.png" alt="Survey results in a Google Sheets document">
                <p>Going by order of questions in the survey, the first thing I looked at was the different most common online stores people use. <mark>All 45 participants shop on the Amazon marketplace</mark>. Target and Walmart online marketplaces were also fairly popular, so I decided to complete an analysis of their similar and different features to define the ones that would work best for Sunderland's online marketplace.</p>
                <img class="pic2" src="./photos/past/graph1.png" alt="Survey results in a Google Sheets document">
                <p>I also found that out of all the categories that were surveyed, technology is the most bought category on Amazon marketplace, followed by entertainment, as seen above. However, the majority of the most recent Amazon purchases were kitchen and bathroom items such as a cutting board, snacks, and espresso glasses. This could show that the phrasing of the questions was potentially misleading. This was also a multiple select question, so while technology was the most selected, all participants selected more than one category. <mark>I decided to not take these answers into account due to the misleading phrasing and resulting information.</mark></p>
                <p>Due to the fact that Amazon is most similar to what Sundaland will be based off of, I decided to ask participants some of their favorite and least favorite features on the Amazon marketplace.</p>
                <p>Some of their favorite features included:
                    <ul class="unlist">
                        <li>Easy to view the prices for each product on the marketplace</li>
                        <li>Fast shipping after ordering</li>
                        <li>Recommended tab using past purchases to show other products of interest</li>
                        <li>Wish list or “save for later” tab</li>
                        <li>Plenty of options for different products</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <p>Some of their least favorite features included:
                    <ul class="unlist">
                        <li>Ugly website interface, overcrowded and not great color usage, and generally looks kinda tacky</li>
                        <li>Returns and address changing pages are not user friendly (is this on purpose?)</li>
                        <li>Too many repeats of items</li>
                        <li>The recommendations are not actually anything of interest to a user</li>
                        <li>Limited filter options</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <img class="pic2" src="./photos/past/graph2.png" alt="Survey results in a Google Sheets document">
                <p>When transitioning to seeing if people would be interested in more sustainable options, I got a positive response for who would be interested in buying more sustainable products. <mark>All of the participants scored a 3 or higher on the scale of 1-5 in buying sustainable products.</mark> In addition, 69% of participants scored themselves a 4 or higher. This means that there is a lot of interest in the products that Sundaland would offer. However, when asked if one would be willing to pay more for sustainable products, only about 50% of participants scored themselves a 4 or higher, with several people also scoring a 2 out of 5 for interest. Even still, there is decent interest in sustainable products and the price that comes with buying them.</p>
                <p>When surveying participants, I tried to get a broad spectrum of responses to the survey. There was a pretty even split of genders, with 53.3% of participants being female and 46.7% of participants being male. There was also a participant age range of 16-56 (the majority were still between 18-22 but there were several responses that represented different age groups perspectives). The sampling process was mainly convenience sampling, which made it hard to get a fully representative sample, but it gave me some valuable insight that I planned to do when developing Sundaland.</p>
                <h4 id="take">Takeaways</h4>
                <p>I felt that Sundaland filled a gap in the ecommerce market. After analyzing the common online marketplaces, I found that there weren’t many options that focused on accessibility, while also maintaining sustainability. Amazon, which would be Sundaland's main competitor, lacks environmental standards and also usability functions as a result of their business model: quantity over quality. <mark>The biggest goal at Sundaland is maintaining high standards of ethical procedure in all aspects paired with a higher quality user experience.</mark></p>
                <p>Amazon has some aspects of the web design that are not as user friendly as they could be. One issue that comes with having such a vast variety of products is the task of efficiently sorting and prioritizing them. Many of the participants complained that there were too many products offered on the site and it made it overwhelming to browse without searching for a specific product. I wanted to aim to avoid this strictly functional approach by <mark>giving Sundaland's customers better filter and sorting options</mark>. Additionally, simply carrying less items would greatly reduce this issue. Another aspect of Amazon that many users dislike is the overall user interface of the website. The participants found the website to be “tacky” and “ugly”. Incorporating more character and stylistic designs into Sundaland’s web interface would not only improve the user’s experience, but could potentially attract a wider variety of demographics who value the website aesthetics.</p>
                <p>The biggest challenge was going to be <mark>convincing customers to stray from their trusted ecommerce sources</mark>. Many people are already very comfortable and familiar with Amazon and other large corporations, making it difficult to present a compelling alternative. Regardless, my team and I were ready to try to develop an idea that would be competitive.</p>

            <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
            <p>In Fall 2022, I took a class called CSCI 3002: Fundamentals in Human Computer Interaction in the Engineering School at CU Boulder. In this class I learned about the process of developing a new application using user centric design thinking. </p>
            <p>In this class, I worked with another student to <mark>complete the full user experience research process as well as start developing a low fidelity design of an application</mark>. My partner and I created the application Sundaland, a site that provides a space for small businesses who sell sustainable products and customers who are looking for sustainable product options to connect.</p>
