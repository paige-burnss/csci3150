            <img class="picofme" src="./photos/picofme.JPG" alt="Picture of Paige Burns">
            <p class="intro">Hey there, I’m Paige! I’m a fourth year student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying computer
                science and marketing. Here at CU I am a member of programs such as the Leeds Scholars 
                Program and Presidents Leadership Class, as well as clubs such as Leeds Consulting Group.
            </p>
            <p class="intro"> I love product design becasue it is the perfect combination of art, business, 
                and engineering. It has given me opportunities to find creative ways to help others 
                and solve problems. 
            </p>
            <p class="intro"> Outside of work and school, I am a huge book and movie nerd. I am also a Colorado Native, 
                and I love to stay active and get outdoors. I love to snowboard, hike, and go paddle
                boarding. I also love to travel have been to 23 national parks and 16 countries! In fact, 
                in 2023, I lived abroad in Sweden while studying at Uppsala University for a semester.
