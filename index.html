                <p>Hey there, I’m Paige! I’m a fourth year student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying computer science and marketing. Here at CU I am a member of programs such as the Leeds Scholars Program and Presidents Leadership Class, as well as clubs such as Leeds Consulting Group.</p>
                <p>I love product design becasue it is the perfect combination of art, business, and engineering. It has given me opportunities to find creative ways to help others and solve problems. </p>
                <p>Outside of work and school, I am a huge book and movie nerd. I am also a Colorado Native, and I love to stay active and get outdoors. I love to snowboard, hike, and go paddle boarding. I also love to travel have been to 23 national parks and 16 countries! In fact, in 2023, I lived abroad in Sweden while studying at Uppsala University for a semester.</p>
