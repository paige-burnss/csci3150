                <h2>About Me:</h2>
                <img class="picofme" src="./photos/index/picofme.JPG" alt="Paige Burns(21 years old, brown hair) in a neon green jumpsuit">
                <p class="intro">Hey there, I’m Paige! I’m a fourth year student at the University of Colorado Boulder studying computer
                    science and marketing. Here at CU I am a member of programs such as the Leeds Scholars 
                    Program and Presidents Leadership Class, as well as clubs such as Leeds Consulting Group.
                </p>
                <p class="intro"> I love product design becasue it is the perfect combination of art, business, 
                    and engineering. It has given me opportunities to find creative ways to help others 
                    and solve problems. 
                </p>
                <p class="intro"> Outside of work and school, I am a huge book and movie nerd. I am also a Colorado Native, 
                    and I love to stay active and get outdoors. I love to snowboard, hike, and go paddle
                    boarding. I also love to travel have been to 23 national parks and 16 countries! In fact, 
                    in 2023, I lived abroad in Sweden while studying at Uppsala University for a semester.
