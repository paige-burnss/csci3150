                <img src="./photos/universal design.png" alt="People of varying abilities, with a vectored design" class="bigpic">
                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>According to the Centre for Excellence in Universal Design, UD is "the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability."</p>

                <h3>7 Principles of UX Design</h3>
                <details>
                    <summary>Princple 1: Equitable Use</summary>
                    <p>The design is useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities.</p>
                    <p>Guidelines:</p>
                    <ul class="guide">
                        <li>1a: Provide the same means of use for all users: identical whenever possible; equivalent when not.</li>
                        <li>1b: Avoid segregating or stigmatizing any users.</li>
                        <li>1c: Provisions for privacy, security, and safety should be equally available to all users.</li>
                        <li>1d: Make the design appealing to all users.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example: A counter space or desk surface may be raised or lowered to accommodate users of varying height, or an individual who uses a wheelchair.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Princple 2: Flexibility in Use</summary>
                    <p>The design accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities.</p>
                    <p>Guidelines:</p>
                    <ul class="guide">
                        <li>2a: Provide choice in methods of use.</li>
                        <li>2b: Accommodate right- or left-handed access and use.</li>
                        <li>2c: Facilitate the user's accuracy and precision.</li>
                        <li>2d: Provide adaptability to the user's pace.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example: A captioned video will allow people to choose to listen or to read in order to understand content. This not only provides access to individuals with hearing impairments but also accommodates those who would rather not use sound or who comprehend better through reading.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Princple 3: Simple and Intuitive Use</summary>
                    <p>Use of the design is easy to understand, regardless of the user’s experience, knowledge, language skills, or current concentration level.</p>
                    <p>Guidelines:</p>
                    <ul class="guide">
                        <li>3a: Eliminate unnecessary complexity.</li>
                        <li>3b: Be consistent with user expectations and intuition.</li>
                        <li>3c: Accommodate a wide range of literacy and language skills.</li>
                        <li>3d: Arrange information consistent with its importance.</li>
                        <li>3e: Provide effective prompting and feedback during and after task completion.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example: A website that is well-organized with clear headings will facilitate access to information.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Princple 4: Perceptible Information</summary>
                    <p>The design communicates necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of ambient conditions or the user’s sensory abilities.</p>
                    <p>Guidelines:</p>
                    <ul class="guide">
                        <li>4a: Use different modes (pictorial, verbal, tactile) for redundant presentation of essential information.</li>
                        <li>4b: Provide adequate contrast between essential information and its surroundings.</li>
                        <li>4c: Maximize "legibility" of essential information.</li>
                        <li>4d: Differentiate elements in ways that can be described (i.e., make it easy to give instructions or directions).</li>
                        <li>4e: Provide compatibility with a variety of techniques or devices used by people with sensory limitations./li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example: A video includes a voiceover for individuals with visual impairments.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Princple 5: Tolerance for Error</summary>
                    <p>The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</p>
                    <p>Guidelines:</p>
                    <ul class="guide">
                        <li>5a: Arrange elements to minimize hazards and errors: most used elements, most accessible; hazardous elements eliminated, isolated, or shielded.</li>
                        <li>5b: Provide warnings of hazards and errors.</li>
                        <li>5c: Provide fail safe features.</li>
                        <li>5d: Discourage unconscious action in tasks that require vigilance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example: A hallway that is free of protruding objects at a height where they would not be detectable by someone with a visual impairment who uses a cane.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Princple 6: Low Physical Effort</summary>
                    <p>The design can be used efficiently and comfortably and with a minimum of fatigue.</p>
                    <p>Guidelines:</p>
                    <ul class="guide">
                        <li>6a: Allow user to maintain a neutral body position.</li>
                        <li>6b: Use reasonable operating forces.</li>
                        <li>6c: Minimize repetitive actions.</li>
                        <li>6d: Minimize sustained physical effort.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example: An automatic door opener can facilitate access to an office space or classroom.</p>
                </details>
                <details>
                    <summary>Princple 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use</summary>
                    <p>Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user’s body size, posture, or mobility.</p>
                    <p>Guidelines:</p>
                    <ul class="guide">
                        <li>7a: Provide a clear line of sight to important elements for any seated or standing user.</li>
                        <li>7b: Make reach to all components comfortable for any seated or standing user.</li>
                        <li>7c: Accommodate variations in hand and grip size.</li>
                        <li>7d: Provide adequate space for the use of assistive devices or personal assistance.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example: A classroom includes a range of seating options, including a table for someone who uses a wheelchair or wider chairs for individuals who are taller and/or larger.</p>
                </details>
